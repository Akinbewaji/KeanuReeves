                        Born in Beirut, Lebanon, on September 2, 1964, the son of Patricia (née Taylor), a costume designer and performer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves Jr. I last met my father on the Hawaiian island of Kauai when I was 13. My parents divorced in 1966, my mother moved the family to Sydney, and then to New York City, where she married Paul Aaron, a Broadway and Hollywood director, in 1970. A year after, they divorced. At age nine, I took part in a theatre production of Damn Yankees. Growing up, I attended De La Salle College, became a successful hockey player and had aspirations to become a professional for the Canadian Olympic Team, however, I decided to be an actor at 15. After leaving De La Salle College, I attended Avondale Secondary Alternative School, which allowed me to get an education while working as an actor.

                <article class="actingCareer">
                    I began my career as a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) youth television program Going Great. That same year, he made his acting debut in an episode of the television series, called Hangin'. In 1985, he played Mercutio in a stage production of Romeo and Juliet at the Leah Posluns Theatre in North York, Ontario. I made a foray into television films in 1986, including NBC's Babes in Toyland, Act of Vengeance and Brotherhood of Justice. I made his first motion picture appearances in Peter Markle's Youngblood (1986), in which he played a goalkeeper, and in the low-budget romantic drama, Flying. I was cast as Matt in River's Edge, a crime drama about a group of high school friends dealing with a murder case, loosely based on the 1981 murder of Marcy Renee Conrad.
                    The film premiered in 1986 at the Toronto International Film Festival to a largely positive response. Janet Maslin of The New York Times describes the performances of the young cast as "natural and credible", with Reeves being described as "affecting and sympathetic". Towards the end of the 1980s, Reeves starred in several dramas aimed at teen audiences, including as the lead in The Night Before (1988), a comedy starring opposite Lori Loughlin, The Prince of Pennsylvania (1988) and Permanent Record (1988). Although the latter received mixed reviews, Variety magazine praised Reeves's performance, "which opens up nicely as the drama progresses" my other acting efforts included a supporting role in Dangerous Liaisons (1988), which earned seven nominations at the 61st Academy Awards, winning three: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and Best Production Design This was followed by Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), in which I portrays a slacker who travels through time with a friend (portrayed by Alex Winter), to assemble historical figures for a school presentation. In 1990, I gave two acting performances; I portrayed an incompetent hitman in the black comedy I Love You to Death, and played Martin, a radio station employee in the comedy Tune in Tomorrow.

                    In 1998, Reeves met director David Lynch's assistant Jennifer Syme at a party thrown for his band Dogstar, and they started dating. On December 24, 1999, Syme gave birth eight months into her pregnancy to the couple's child, who was stillborn. The couple broke up several weeks afterward, but later reconciled. On April 2, 2001, Syme was killed when her vehicle collided with three parked cars on Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles. Syme was impaired, and also not belted in. Reeves told investigators that they were back together, and had brunch together in San Francisco the day before the accident. Reeves acted as a pallbearer for Syme, who was buried next to their daughter. He was scheduled to film the sequels to The Matrix the following spring, but sought "peace and time", according to friend Bret Domrose of Dogstar. Reeves has also been romantically linked to longtime friend and filmmaker Brenda Davis, whose child he is godfather to, and model-actress China Chow. In 2009, Reeves met Alexandra Grant at a dinner party; they went on to collaborate on two books together. They went public with their relationship in November 2019. Reeves is discreet about his spiritual beliefs, saying that it is something "personal and private". When asked if he was a spiritual person, he said that he believes "in God, faith, inner faith, the self, passion, and things", and that he is "very spiritual" and "supremely bountiful". Although he does not formally practice Buddhism, the religion has left a strong impression on him, especially after filming Little Buddha. He said, "Most of the things I've come away with from Buddhism have been human—understanding feelings, impermanence, and trying to understand other people and where they're coming from." When asked on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2019 about his views on what happens after death, Reeves replied, "I know that the ones who love us will miss us".[216] In 2023, the lipopeptide Keanumycin, a substance deadly to fungi, was named in honor of Reeves

                    I support several charities and causes. In response to my sister's battle with leukemia, I founded a private cancer foundation, which aids children's hospitals and provides cancer research. In June 2020, I volunteered for Camp Rainbow Gold, an Idaho children's cancer charity. I said, "Money is the last thing I think about. I could live on what I have already made for the next few centuries". It was rumoured that I gave away a substantial portion, estimated to be $35 - $125 million, of my earnings from The Matrix to the special effects and makeup crews. However, this has been significantly embellished; I negotiated a smaller deal, relinquishing my contractual right to a percentage of the sequels' profits in exchange for a more extensive special effects budget. After filming John Wick: Chapter 4, Chad Stahelski, Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor Dave Camarillo and I, signed an exclusive training uniform that was put up for auction in March 2023 to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. I co-founded a production company, Company Films, with friend Stephen Hamel. In 2011, Reeves, an avid motorcyclist, co-founded <a href="https://archmotorcycle.com/" target="_blank" class="special">Arch Motorcycle Company</a>, which builds and sells custom motorcycles, with Gard Hollinger. In 2017, I, Jessica Fleischmann, and Alexandra Grant founded book publisher, X Artists' Books (also known as XAB). I have written two books: Ode to Happiness and Shadows, both of which are collaborations with Grant; I provided the text to her photographs and art.
